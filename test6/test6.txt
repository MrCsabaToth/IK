9. Can RDBMS act as single server K-V stores?
FALSE -> TRUE
No, because RDBMS is not schemaless
Not all RDBMS support JSON fields
Won't scale as much

10. Can RDBMS act as distributed K-V stores?
TRUE -> FALSE
If the previous question is TRUE, then with replication and sharding we should be able to
Although it won't scale as a K-V store


16. Update of row-oriented storage of K-V records can be performed
In-place
* Out-of-place in an append-only log
either ways

Can be done in-place but that's not how it's done: it could cuase data contention.
RocksDB, MyRocks: mysql query engine w rocksdb instead of innodb
MongoDB in-place (????)

19. How do column-oriented K-V stores manage writes
Performs multiple writes on individual columnar units for every K-V write
* Maintains a separate append-only log (aka journal) which is then resolved with existing columar units

Could be done either way. If Q16 can be either way, this can be either way as well.

30. What is the problem of mapping a single K-V to a server or set of servers
No problem
Metadata bloat in the cluster manager
Uncontrolled rebalancing
* 2 and 3 (turnsa out to be the right answer)

Only metadata. Was not sure about uncontrolled rebalancing.

33. In a 3 replica master-slave architecture, value of N is
N = 1
* N = 3

I thought that maybe in such a system the master can still ask the slaves to obtain a quorum status

35. What is the workload nature of URL shortener system
Read heavy
* Write heavy
Mixed workload

Didn't remember it being read heavy more than expected.
