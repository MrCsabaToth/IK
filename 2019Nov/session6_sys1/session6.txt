URL Shortener:

~ 4 trillion URLs

4 * (10^3)^4 = 4 * 10 ^ 12 ~ 2^2 * (2^10)^4 = 2^42

a) long to short
b) foxed length 7 characters
c) translating back
d) 1:m is fine

two microservices: L2S, S2L

base64 33% overhead

a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ - 64^7 = 2^6^7 = 2^42

The integer sequence rows solution can be beneficial if the URLs are close to 4 trillion and the DB is filled up =>
collision could be often
